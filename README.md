# Rain-no-rain-merging
This code is based on the categorical triple collocation based merging (CTC-M, https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0097.1) proposed by Jianzhi Dong. 
The CTC-M algorithm can be used to merge independent binary data to achieve an optimal categorical dataset, which has been tested in rain/no-rain merging.
